## Questionnaire

Project created using `React.js` and `styled-components`. It fetches the data from a `json` and generates the question based on its type.

Demo [here](https://react-questionnaire-madaf.netlify.com/).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` 

- to install the node-modules

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
